## Description
 In the NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API, you are tasked with building an API for a social network web application using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM. MongoDB's popularity in social networks stems from its speed with large data volumes and flexibility with unstructured data. The project requires users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage friend lists. To format timestamps, you can use a JavaScript date library or the native Date object. Additionally, a walkthrough video demonstrating the application's functionality must be created since the project won't be deployed.

## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Summary
The challenge involves building an API for a social network web application using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The API should allow users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The application won't be deployed, so a walkthrough video demonstrating its functionality is required.

The user story is about a social media startup needing an API for their social network that uses a NoSQL database to handle large amounts of unstructured data.

Acceptance criteria include starting the server, syncing Mongoose models to the MongoDB database, displaying data in JSON format for GET routes, and successfully creating, updating, and deleting users, thoughts, reactions, and friends using API routes in Insomnia.

The mock-up includes animations demonstrating testing of various API routes in Insomnia for users, thoughts, friends, and reactions.

The models for the User and Thought include specific fields and schema settings, such as virtuals for friend count and reaction count, and default values for timestamps.

API routes include endpoints for managing users, thoughts, friends, and reactions, allowing actions like creating, updating, and deleting users, thoughts, friends, and reactions.
